# WhatsNext_integration

WhatsNext is an app.
This app's goal is to simplify music listening when you are in a party or when a group of people wants to listen to music together.

EXAMPLE : 
you are in a party, you play music on your phone or you laptop, and your friend wants to add another song.
problem : He has to ask you the access to your device (password, unlock screen...).
For one times it's ok, but when it's like this everytime someone else wants to add a new song, it's a bit boring...

So with WhatsNext :
you are in a party,
1. You connect to WhatsNext.
2. You create a lobby.
3. Your friends connect to WhatsNext and join your lobby (from there smartphone, or other device).
4. Everyone can search for a song and add it to a playlist.
5. You, as admin, manage the playlist (decide if you want, or not, to play the song, or the order of the songs, etc.).
6. The playlist just plays everyone's song, and everybody's happy !
